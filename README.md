## 2024 Strategies of Implementing Data to drive Monetary Growth and its Ethics
In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, two articles shed light on the transformative power of data and technology monetization, emphasizing the responsibility that comes with this potential for growth. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In WSTJ's article, titled [How Companies Can Drive Growth Through Data, Tech Monetization](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/how-companies-can-drive-growth-through-data-tech-monetization-63bf077d), it draws insights from Deloitte's 2023 Global Technology Leadership Study. It explores the challenges and opportunities presented to tech leaders in monetizing their data and software. The piece highlights various strategies, such as selling data sets, providing insights through Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) models, embedding data into existing products, and collaborating with ecosystem partners. The emphasis is on the importance of maintaining data privacy and protection, with a recognition that successful monetization requires organizational transformation and a commitment to data governance.

The Deloitte study presented in the first article provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with data and technology monetization. The identified approaches, such as selling data sets, offering insights through PaaS models, and embedding data into products, reflect the diverse strategies companies employ. The emphasis on collaboration with ecosystem partners adds a collaborative dimension to monetization efforts. However, the article appropriately underscores the need for a holistic approach, considering data privacy, protection, and the evolving regulatory landscape. The mention of the importance of organizational transformation and data governance aligns with the broader narrative that successful monetization extends beyond technological considerations to encompass cultural and strategic shifts within companies.

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in first piece on the issue, the second article, published on insideBIGDATA, [Looking to 2024: Data, AI and Security will be Top Priorities for Businesses](https://insidebigdata.com/2024/01/29/looking-to-2024-data-ai-and-security-will-be-top-priorities-for-businesses/) focuses on the technology landscape's trajectory in 2024. Authored by Nathan Vega, the Vice President of Product Marketing and Strategy at Protegrity, the article anticipates the continuing impact of AI, data science, deep learning, and machine learning. It underscores the evolving dynamics of transparency in handling customer data, the fragmented nature of AI adoption, the critical role of data protection amidst increasing AI utilization, and the growing importance of data security in the post-pandemic work environment.

Nathan Vega's forward-looking analysis in the second article delves into the evolving technology landscape of 2024. The anticipation of AI's continued growth is tempered by a realistic acknowledgment of the sector's current fragmentation and the persistent challenge of a skills shortage. The article also emphasizes the critical role of data protection in the context of AI, recognizing the potential privacy concerns and the need for solutions like tokenization. The discussion on disinformation and the impact of AI underscores the dual-edged nature of technological advancements, where attackers can exploit AI faster than defenders can adapt. Furthermore, the article astutely links the post-pandemic shift to remote work with heightened data security considerations, making a compelling case for the intertwining of technological evolution and the changing dynamics of the modern workforce.

Both articles converge on the idea that data and technology, when strategically monetized and safeguarded, serve as catalysts for innovation, growth, and competitive differentiation. They collectively highlight the imperative for businesses to navigate the complex terrain of data monetization, AI adoption, and security, all while prioritizing transparency, ethical practices, and compliance with evolving regulations.
